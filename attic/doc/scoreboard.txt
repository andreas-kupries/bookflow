tuple {PROJECT CREATE} {
    Signal from the directory scanner to the creation task to generate
    a new project (database).
} {
}

tuple {PROJECT VERIFY} {
    Signal from the directory scanner to the verification task to
    cross-check an existing project (database).
} {
}

tuple {PROJECT ERROR <msg>} {
    Message for the user interface to post.
} {
}

tuple {PROJECT SERVER <thread>} {
    Access to project database is mediated by the thread with id <thread>.
} {
}

tuple {AT <path>} {
    The location of the current project (directory), as absolute path.
} {
}

tuple {DATABASE <name>} {
    The name/path of the database file, relative to the project directory.
    Also a signal to the project database access layer to provide access.
} {
}

tuple {FILE <path>} {
    Name/path of an image file found by the scanner, relative to the project
    directory. Used by either creation or verification task, i.e. make
    them images, or compare to current images.
} {
}

tuple {BOOK <name>} {
    Name of a book found in the project (database).
} {
}

tuple {IMAGE <path> <serial> <book>} {
    Name/path of a verified page image file in the project,
    with reference to the book it belongs to, and a serial
    number providing the ordering within the book.
} {
}

tuple {!THUMBNAIL <path> <size>} {
    Signal to invalidate the <size>d thumbnail of page
    image <path>.
} {
}

tuple {THUMBNAIL <path> <size> <dstpath>} {
    <dstpath> is the location of the <sized>d thumbnail for
    page image <path>. All paths are relative to the project
    (directory).
} {
}

tuple {SCALE <path> <size> <dst>} {
    Order to resize page image <path> to <size>, and store the
    result in <dst>.
} {
}

tuple {!GREYSCALE <path>} {
    Signal to invalidate the greyscale derivation of page
    image <path>.
} {
}

tuple {GREYSCALE <path> <dstpath>} {
    <dstpath> is the location of the greyscale derivation of
    page image <path>. All paths are relative to the project
    (directory).
} {
}

tuple {GREYCONVERT <path> <dst>} {
    Order to compute the greyscale of page image <path> and
    store the result in <dst>.
} {
}

tuple {!STATISTICS <path>} {
    Signal to invalidate the statistics of page image <path>.
} {
}

tuple {STATISTICS <path> <stats>} {
    <stats> are the statistics of page image <path>.
} {
}

tuple {STATSQ <path>} {
    Order to compute the statistics of page image <path>.
