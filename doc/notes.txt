Possible scan errors
====================

duplicate pages
missing markers	- insert fake marker
missing pages	- insert fake (empty) page/placeholder
missing cover	- insert fake cover (see fake page)
missing lightfield - synthesize

cover scanned out of order (last instead of first, or in the middle).

Heuristics
==========

detect marker
detect lightfield
synthesize lightfield
page brightness (-> grey -> mean, or hsv -> value -> mean)
page color (-> hsv -> hue -> mean)
picture orientation
detect page number => orientation cue, even/odd cue, number itself for
order
compare pages (similarity = detect duplicate)
first order by image name

crimp - ppm file - save/read HSV!
crimp - up/down sample x/y separate

auto-dpi = 6 lines/height
auto-dpi via markers (square lines - also perspective warp, global)

auto-crop

scan tailor mixed mode tiff image

If I flip the pure-black pixels to white, I have the graphical version
of the image. If I flip non-pure-black pixels to white, I have the
textual version of the image. Yes?

== pure black = text
== grey-scale = grey images, never going up to pure black (255)
