Scoreboard API
==============

put <tuple>...

	Places the specified tuples into the scoreboard.
	May return before the tuples are fully stored.
	May release 'take' requests waiting on a pattern matching any of the tuples.
	May trigger 'added' notifications for patterns matching the tuples.

take <pattern> <cmd>

	Asks the scoreboard to invoke <cmd> when a tuple matching the
	<pattern> is present, with the matching tuple as argument.

	At the time of invokation the tuple is removed from the
	scoreboard.

	Returns before <cmd> is invoked.

	If no matching tuple is present the system will wait until
	such a tuple exists. Possibly waiting indefinitely.

	Multiple 'take' requests waiting on tuples are served in order
	of arrival. I.e. the earliest request matching a tuple is
	invoked, with the remainder waitng for the next tuple. As new
	requests are adding to the end of this list each request R
	will be served at some point if enough tuples matching its
	pattern are added to the scoreboard. Matching requests coming
	after R cannot pre-empt it.

	May trigger 'removed' notifications for patterns matching the
	taken tuple.

takeall <pattern> <cmd>

	Like 'take', with two differences.

	It doesn't wait for matching tuples to be present.

	If none are there <cmd> is invoked with the empty list.

	If tuples match however then all of them are removed
	from the scoreboard and given to <cmd>.

	May trigger 'removed' notifications for patterns matching the
	taken tuples.
