Scoreboard API
==============

put <tuple>...

	Places the specified tuples into the scoreboard.
	May return before the tuples are fully stored.
	May release 'take' requests waiting on a pattern matching any of the tuples.
	May trigger 'added' notifications for patterns matching the tuples.

take <pattern> <cmd>

	Asks the scoreboard to invoke <cmd> when a tuple matching the
	<pattern> is present, with the matching tuple as argument.

	At the time of invokation the tuple is removed from the
	scoreboard.

	Returns before <cmd> is invoked.

	If no matching tuple is present the system will wait until
	such a tuple exists. Possibly waiting indefinitely.

	Multiple 'take' requests waiting on the exact same pattern are
	served in the order of their arrival at the scoreboard.

	Multiple 'take' requests with different patterns competing for
	the same matching tuple are served in arbitrary order (Tcl's
	order of 'array names'). This allows for live-lock to occur
	where a 'take' request X is always pre-empted by different
	requests, even if they there made after X itself.

	May trigger 'removed' notifications for patterns matching the
	taken tuple.

takeall <pattern> <cmd>

	Like 'take', with two differences.

	It doesn't wait for matching tuples to be present.

	If none are there <cmd> is invoked with the empty list.

	If tuples match however then all of them are removed
	from the scoreboard and given to <cmd>.

	May trigger 'removed' notifications for patterns matching the
	taken tuples.
