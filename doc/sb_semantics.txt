Scoreboard API
==============

put <tuple>...

	Places the specified tuples into the scoreboard.
	May return before the tuples are fully stored.
	May release 'take' requests waiting on a pattern matching any of the tuples.
	May trigger 'added' notifications for patterns matching the tuples.

take <pattern> <cmd>

	Asks the scoreboard to invoke <cmd> when a tuple matching the
	<pattern> is present, with the matching tuple as argument.

	At the time of invokation the tuple is removed from the
	scoreboard.

	Returns before <cmd> is invoked.

	If no matching tuple is present the system will wait until
	such a tuple exists. Possibly waiting indefinitely.

	Multiple 'take' requests waiting on tuples are served in order
	of arrival. I.e. the earliest request matching a tuple is
	invoked, with the remainder waitng for the next tuple. As new
	requests are adding to the end of this list each request R
	will be served at some point if enough tuples matching its
	pattern are added to the scoreboard. Matching requests coming
	after R cannot pre-empt it.

	May trigger 'removed' notifications, for patterns matching the
	taken tuple.

	May trigger 'missing' notifications, for patterns not matching
	a tuple at the time of the request.

takeall <pattern> <cmd>

	Like 'take', with two differences.

	It doesn't wait for matching tuples to be present.

	If none are there <cmd> is invoked with the empty list.

	If tuples match however then all of them are removed
	from the scoreboard and given to <cmd>.

	May trigger 'removed' notifications for patterns matching the
	taken tuples.

peek <pattern> <cmd>

	Like 'takeall', except that the matching tuples are not
	removed from the scoreboard. As such it will not generate
	'take' notifications either.

wpeek <pattern> <cmd>

	The 'waiting peek' is like peek in that it doesn't remove a
	tuple matching the pattern. It is however like 'take', waiting
	for the appearance of a matching tuple is no such is present
	when the request is made.


bind put     <pattern> <cmd>
bind take    <pattern> <cmd>
bind missing <pattern> <cmd>

	These methods bind a <cmd> callback to a particular action
	(put/take) and tuple <pattern>. Each occurence of the action
	for a tuple matching the pattern causes an invokation of the
	callback.

	The contents of the scoreboard are not modified.

	In this manner it is possible to wait for a tuple to appear,
	like 'take', but without actually removing the tuple.

	Note that if a tuple is added via 'put' and immediately
	'take'n two notifications may be generation, for both the
	'put', and the 'take', in this order.

	The 'missing' event is invoked if a 'take' or 'wpeek' had to
	wait for a matching tuple, and the pattern, treated as tuple,
	matched the pattern for the event.

unbind ...

	Remove event bindings.
