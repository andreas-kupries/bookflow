While I want bookflow to be mostly automatic when identifying pages,
markers and processing everything, writing the automatics will take
time and I wish to process the books I have now. So, some commands
have to be implemented which go towards that goal.

This actually may have another advantage. Training data. Perfectly
labeled images which can used to train some type of system for the
image classification.

Most interactivity is through the keyboard, which is generally quicker.

	Key	Note	Command		Notes
	---	----	-------		-----
(i)	SPACE		show next
(ii)	->	cursor	show next	change of selection, active item
(iii)	<-	cursor	show previous	s.a.
	---	----	-------		-----
(iv)	b		label as black marker
(v)	w		label as white marker = lightfield
(vi)	c		label as cover (front, back automatic based on the
				       section we are in)
	---	----	-------		----

The commands (iv) and (v) are enough for the system to then
automatically determine the locations of the composite markers
delimiting the various sections (garbage, even, odd), and label the
pages in the sections. The command (vi) is needed to fix the pages
which are the covers and likely mislabled as plain pages.

When all pages (for a book) are labeled we can trigger the next phase,
which

(a) places them into a separate (new) book
(b) associates each page with the nearest preceding lightfield in
    imaging order.
(c) re-orders them front to back
(d) rotates the derived images (thumbnail, page display) upright

    NOTE: the base images are not modified.
    NOTE: this is done by invalidating the data and then using the
	  labels in the scaler tasks to determine the use of rotations.
    NOTE: rotate after scaling, less data to handle.

    A problem, we have to note somewhere which thumbnails have been
    rotated, and which don't. Likely in the project database, as an
    annotation.
